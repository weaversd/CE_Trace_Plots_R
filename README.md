# CE_Trace_Plots_R

Code for importing and plotting data from CE runs in R. For raw files from labview, the important functions are in 'plot_CE_overlay', and for those from comercial sciex instruments they are in 'Sciex_CE_import'. This repo is being actively updated and changed day to day. See commments in code for latest information.
